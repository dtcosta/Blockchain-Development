# Creating a Blockchain using Proof of Authority

For this project, I will take on the role of a new developer at a small bank.

My mission will be to set up a testnet blockchain for our organization.

To do this, I will create and submit four deliverables:

* Set up a custom testnet blockchain.

* Send a test transaction.

* Create a repository.

* Write instructions on how to use the chain for the rest of the team.

## Background

I have just landed a new job at ZBank, a small, innovative bank that is interested in exploring what
blockchain technology can do for them and their customers.

My first project at the company is to set up a private testnet that the team of developers
can use to explore potentials for blockchain at ZBank.

We have decided on setting up a testnet because:

There is no real money involved, which will give the team of developers the freedom to experiment.

Testnets allow for offline development.

In order to set up a testnet, it is advised that you have a general knowledge of:

* Puppeth, to generate genesis block.

* Geth, a command-line tool, to create keys, initialize nodes, and connect the nodes together.

* The Clique Proof of Authority algorithm.

Tokens inherently have no value here, so we will provide pre-configured accounts and nodes for easy setup.
